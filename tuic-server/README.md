## Overview

`tuic-server` is a robust and actively developed implementation of the TUIC protocol server. It is a fork of the original TUIC project with significant enhancements and additional features. While it started as a reference implementation, it has evolved to include many production-ready capabilities.

This fork includes advanced features such as Docker support, self-signed certificate capabilities, automatic certificate hot-reloading, updated dependencies, and improved performance through more relaxed locks. It is suitable for both learning and production environments.

---

## Features

- Minimal TUIC protocol server implementation
- TOML and legacy JSON configuration support
- Flexible ACL (Access Control List) system
- Multiple outbound proxy modes (direct, SOCKS5, etc.)
- TLS support with auto-provisioning and self-signed certificates
- RESTful API for monitoring and management
- Docker and Docker Compose deployment options

---

## Installation

### Download Prebuilt Binary

Get the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Itsusinn/tuic/releases).

### Install via Cargo

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/Itsusinn/tuic.git tuic-server
```

---

## Usage

Run the TUIC server with a configuration file:

```bash
# Specify config file directly
tuic-server -c PATH/TO/CONFIG

# Specify config directory (automatically finds first config file)
tuic-server -d PATH/TO/CONFIG_DIR

# Generate example configuration file
tuic-server --init
```

The `-d/--dir` option searches for the first recognizable configuration file (`.toml`, `.json`, `.json5`, `.yaml`, `.yml`) in the specified directory, sorted alphabetically. This provides flexibility in Docker deployments and multi-environment setups.

### Docker

```bash
docker run --name tuic-server \
  --restart always \
  --network host \
  -v /PATH/TO/CONFIG_FILE:/etc/tuic/config.toml \
  -v /PATH/TO/CERTIFICATE:/PATH/TO/CERTIFICATE \
  -v /PATH/TO/PRIVATE_KEY:/PATH/TO/PRIVATE_KEY \
  -dit ghcr.io/itsusinn/tuic-server:latest
  ## or -dit docker.io/itsusinn/tuic-server:latest
```

**Note:** The Docker image now uses `-d /etc/tuic` by default, allowing you to mount your config directory.

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  tuic:
    image: ghcr.io/itsusinn/tuic-server:latest
    ## or image: docker.io/itsusinn/tuic-server:latest
    restart: always
    container_name: tuic
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - ./config.toml:/etc/tuic/config.toml:ro  # Mount config file
      #- ./config:/etc/tuic:ro # Mount config directory
      - ./cert.crt:/PATH/TO/CERT:ro
      - ./key.crt:/PATH/TO/KEY:ro
```

The server will automatically detect and use the first config file found in `/etc/tuic`.

---

## Configuration

- **TOML format**: Use `.toml` file extension (recommended for new configurations)
- **JSON5 format**: Use `.json` or `.json5` file extension (legacy format, still supported)
- **Yaml format**: Use `.yaml` or `.yml` file extension

The format is automatically detected based on the file extension. You can also force TOML parsing by setting the `TUIC_FORCE_TOML` environment variable. Or use `TUIC_CONFIG_FORMAT` environment variable to explicitly specify the format (`toml` or `json5`).

### Example configuration

```toml
# Logging level: trace, debug, info, warn, error, off
log_level = "info"

## RESTful API

The server exposes a RESTful API for monitoring and management. Authenticate using the `Authorization: Bearer` header.

Example:

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_HERE' http://ip:port/online
```

Endpoints:

- `GET /online`: List online clients' count.
- `GET /detailed_online`: List online clients' IP addresses and ports.
- `POST /kick`: Kick specified users (clients can reconnect).
- `GET /traffic`: Get current traffic stats.
- `GET /reset_traffic`: Reset and return previous traffic stats.

> Traffic data is lost when the server restarts.

## TLS Certificates

TLS is required for secure connections.

### Built-in ACME Support

`tuic-server` includes built-in ACME support for automatic SSL certificate provisioning via Let's Encrypt. This allows the server to automatically obtain and renew certificates without external tools.

To enable built-in ACME, set the following options in your configuration:

```toml
[tls]
auto_ssl = true
hostname = "your.domain.com" # The domain name for certificate issuance
```

**Notes:**
- The server must be accessible from the public internet on port 80 for ACME HTTP-01 challenge.
- If running as a non-root user on Linux, you may need to allow binding to privileged ports:
  ```sh
  setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip <path to tuic-server binary>
  ```
- If ACME provisioning fails, tuic-server will fall back to self-signed certificates if configured.

You can also use [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh) or other tools to manually obtain certificates:

```sh
acme.sh --issue -d www.yourdomain.org --standalone
acme.sh --install-cert -d www.yourdomain.org \
  --key-file       /CERT_PATH/key.crt  \
  --fullchain-file /CERT_PATH/cert.crt
```

Alternatively, you may use self-signed certificates or provide your own.
